1)	Crowdstrike isn’t working for some of the hosts in the NQA/NPM subnet – is there a global rule allowing this?  If not, can you please draft one up that makes sense for all our systems to talk to the Crowdstrike endpoints – ideally some DNS entry that ends in their CDN or similar.
2)	Nessus/Tenable rules – also not working – there should also be a global rule for this if something doesn’t already exist – can you please look at how we do this in a minimal fashion as well.
3)	RedHat patching – missing rules for that security zone currently – with RHEL8/9 best practice is to go direct to RedHat to get updates – again sounds like a good candidate for a well defined global rule.
